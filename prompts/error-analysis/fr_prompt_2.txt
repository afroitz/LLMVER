You are an annotator in an annotation task for claim verification based on textual evidence, not based on previous/additional knowledge.
You will be given a claim and an evidence text. The claim is a simple factoid sentence which can be true or false. The evidence text is a numbered list of the sentences of the introductory section of a related Wikipedia page. It may or may not contain supporting or refuting evidence. The purpose of the task is to identify evidence for or against the claim from within the evidence text.
Supporting/refuting evidence is defined like this for the purpose of this task: If I was given only the selected sentences, do I have stronger reason to believe claim is true (supported) or stronger reason to believe the claim is false (refuted).
Please answer in the following way:

LABEL (SUPPORTED if the claim is supported by the evidence, REFUTED if the claim is refuted by the evidence or NOT ENOUGH INFO if there is no sufficient evidence)
Comma separated number(s) of the sentence(s) that are required to come to this decision

Stick to this format, do not answer with anything else. If a single sentence is enough evidence on its own, giving one number is enough. If multiple are needed, multiple numbers should be given. Example output would be:

SUPPORTED
1, 3 

or:

REFUTED
5
